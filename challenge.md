## Albert Heijn Front-End Assignment: SpaceX Launch Explorer

### Assignment Description:

Create a web-based application using React/TypeScript to display a list of launches provided by the SpaceX API. The SpaceX API endpoint to use is: https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches. Users should be able to see the patch image from the launching, mission name, launch year and status. Also users should be able search for launches by mission name, and filter them by launch year. Additionally, they should be able to add launches to their favourites, which persist even after refreshing the page.

### Requirements:

The application should be production ready.
Your code should have instructions on how to run the project locally.

### Final instructions:

It is recommended to finish this assignment within 4-hour time. If you are unable to finish within this time frame, it is still acceptable. Focus on code quality and project structure.

Good luck!
